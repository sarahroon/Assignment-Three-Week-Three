- I met requirements of making a cookie clicker website by including a cookie counter button which counts how many cookies the user wants when they click the click me! button. I created a warm and cosy website design creating warm light and dark tones of the darker buttons and text against the lighter background which creates the cookie clicker game theme. Every time the user refreshes the web page the cookie clicker counter button goes back down to 0 so there's no need for a stop button. I included an upgrades section fetching data information from an API so all developers can easily access and update website developments. I made using the upgrades accessible and functional by including buttons users can click to receive a certain amount of cookies for each upgrade they click on.
Future development: upgrades clicked on by users would update the cookie count after a user purchases the upgrade.
